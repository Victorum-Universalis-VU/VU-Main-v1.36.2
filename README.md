# VU-Main
This is the main version of VU 1.36.2*.

Due to complications with Paradox Interactive, this mod will no longer be updated to 1.37.* until said issues are resolved.

Please stop using VU-WIP as that is now for developers only.

Also, this version will only be updated once every month.

HISTORICAL ACCURACY
The sole purpose of this mod and the reason why I started it in the first place is so that I and the VU team can accurately represent the world of 1444 to the best of our abilities and for educational purposes. 

DISCLAIMER
This mod is based on the foundations of the BT mod back when Driocht was still author of that mod. Therefore, I claim no ownership to any of his files or any remnant of BT files that we are gradually getting rid of (due to compatibility issues). 

I Darth Modus (aka San Felipe) and the VU team only claim ownership of content that we have either come up with, produced and or implemented in-house. 

REGARDING HISTORICAL ACCURACY
The mod was NOT created as a means to glorify and or propagate the evils of the world back then, including but not limited to certain practices such as those resulting from the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, Slavery and or Genocide. If there are any slavery and or genocide mechanics in the mod, then that is due to the already present slavery and genocide mechanics present in the host game which we have no control over.

Furthermore, we DO NOT tolerate any racisms of the sort and or mysogyny or anything politically-aligned that may stir up controversy and or is related to the events of our present times. The same rule applies to our Discord server.

JOKES & SARCASTIC HUMOUR
There may be content in the mod that was added by either past or present VU team members that are meant to only be jokes.

We do realise that there may be the possibility that certain individuals are offended by these jokes, jokes and statements mind you that their original authors inserted into the mod through sarcasm and of course in the way they feel they could whilst still conveying a same and or simmilar message. There is nothing in the mod that is meant to be inappropriate, offensive and or disparaging and if any such content is found by some to be the above, then the VU team and I would appreciate feedback so that we can act accordingly in remedying the issue. 

PLEASE NOTE!
We cannot act, remove or change anything that is already in the mod without first seeing evidence of said content that is deemed as inappropriate, offensive and or disparaging since how can anyone make any change if said individual/individuals raising an issue of complaint do no first provide us with an actionable list. We are after all just simple human beings who are ot psychic.

If said content is found, then please visit our server link below to report the issue by pinging one of our mods and or team members and we will get back to you asap.

BRIGADING, DEFAMATION, LIBEL and or FALSE ACCUSATIONS
We treat all cases of brigading, defamation, libel and false accusations very seriously and don't condone behavior of the sort in any form, especially brigading by members on our server or on any Paradox affiliated server and or forums online. 

Furthermore, if any of the above is carried out towards the mod creator and or towards the VU team and or to anyone and or to all at once, then legal proceedings and or criminal filings will immediately follow and or be sought after by either the mod author and or their team members and or server members and or all at once. 

False accusations include:
1) Claims of Stealing UGC - User generated content without permission.
2) Claims of Revocation of Permission to use third party UGC - User generated content.
3) Claims of Piracy involving the Cracking and or Hacking of the base game EU4 and or its dlcs.
5) Claims of Mysogyny.
6) Caims of Racism.
7) Claims of Homosexuality.
8) Claims of Occultism.
9) Claims of an innapropriate manner that involve nudity, sexual scenese and or intercourse of any nature.

BANS ON OTHER SERVERS AND OR SERVERS AFFILIATED WITH PARADOX INTERACTIVE
The banning of the author of this mod and or their team members and or server members from any Discord server and or affiliated Paradox server on Discord without any prior precedence such as evidence (if the mod author speaks their opinions, then bans will be seen as both illegal and or unethical) and or using content from their own server (content not found on the server which has banned them) and using content going back many years (content posted a year or so and over) will immediately result in legal and criminal proceedings following and or sought after by either the mod author and or their team members and or server members and or all at once.

OPINIONS ARE PROTECTED
Everyone has the right to their opinion. This is stated and enshrined within UN Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and I quote states:

"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

Article 11 of the EU - European Unions Charter of Fundamental Rights and I quote also states: 

“This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This also means the freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.” 

Article 10 of United Kingdoms Freedom of Expression EHRC also states the following and I quote:

“Article 10 protects your right to hold your own opinions and to express them freely without government interference. This includes the right to express your views aloud (for example through public protest and demonstrations) or through:

•	published articles, books or leaflets 
•	television or radio broadcasting
•	works of art
•	the internet and social media"

United States law, especially those enshrined in the First Amendment state and I quote:

"The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects the right to freedom of religion and freedom of expression from government interference."

This means that any and all statements made online are protected, so long as it does not do harm towards others. If comments are indeed seen as harmful towards others, then evidence of this must first be provided and must be in accordance to laws in your country of origin and or region if under a superficial government entity such as the EU - European Union, ASEAN, African Union, Union of Latin American Countries, Arab League, BRIX etc.
